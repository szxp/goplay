The simplest case is when the number of rooms (r) and the number of booked rooms (n) is equal. In this case the asnwer is always "too late", regardless of the following n lines of input.

The remaining case is when the number of booked rooms (n) is less than the number of rooms (r).

Room numbers can be used as array indexes.
Let's create an array of size r+1 to remember if a room is booked or not. The index 0 will never be used as a book number.

While reading the input we are going to set the value of the corresponding room in the array to true.

After processing the input we just need to find the first non-booked room in the array and output its index. It is the first index where the corresponding value is false.
